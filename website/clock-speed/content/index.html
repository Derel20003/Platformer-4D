            Imagine waking up one day after having a crazy dream. The dream felt different than usual. More real. more intense. scarier than anything you've ever experienced. William Buckland, an evil scientist, created a black hole that would destroy the entire city, the entire country, and eventually the entire world. Would you look into it? Putting your life in jeopardy just to follow a gut feeling? Chasing a man who you don't know? Or would you just go to work, forget everything, and go back to sleep. No? Then grab your stuff and save the world!
